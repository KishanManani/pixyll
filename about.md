I am currently a Data Scientist at the fintech company Zopa. I completed a PhD in Physics at Imperial College London where I investigated the mechanisms of the most prevalent arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, using a combination of computer modelling and mathematics. During my PhD I also used novel signal processing methods to apply machine learning to large physiological timeseries datasets. 

After my PhD I was awarded a place onto the ASI data science fellowship and transitioned into data science in industry. I'm passionate about using data for good and volunteer at DataKind. I also have a keen interest in using data science and machine learning in personalised health and healthcare.
